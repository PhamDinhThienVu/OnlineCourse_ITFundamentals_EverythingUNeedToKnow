Hey, folks, in this section, we are going to talk about the computer components and the very first

thing that comes in line when we are talking about computer components is the hardware.

Now, what is a hardware?

Before we get into the hardware, we need to find out where they got the the name where w a r, e and

attach it with the hard.

So where actually anything, any merchandise, any products or any goods is aware.

Now in from Wikipedia, computer hardware includes physical parts of a computer such as the case.

Case is also referred to as chassis where everything is combined together in a case.

Then central processing unit which is inside of the computer monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data

storage could be hard disk or external disk, graphic card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.

All of these computer outer.

A devices that are listed here are actually the hardware.

Now, my definition to make it a lot simpler when someone asks you what is a computer hardware, then

I would say anything you can touch in a computer world is a hardware.

Anything you cannot touch is a software or a firmware.

That's a very simple and straightforward definition.

So if someone is going to ask you what kind of computer you have or what kind of hardware you have,

right away, you have to say, I am using Dell Hardware, I'm using HPE Hardware or Sony or whoever

the manufacturer is.

That's what they wanted to know, the manufacturer of the hardware that you have.
