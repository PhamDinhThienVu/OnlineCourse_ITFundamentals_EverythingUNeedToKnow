Hey, folks, in this lecture, we are going to talk about it, security.

Security is another extended component of it when we are talking about all these different components.

Please make sure we are not overlooking the security, which is also one of the most important aspect

in I.T..

Let's take a look at the I.T. security definition.

Security can be referred to as computer security, cybersecurity or I.T. technology.

Security is the protection of computer systems and network from information disclosure teft off or damage

to their hardware, software, electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the

services they provide.

So basically the security to secure your network or your environment, not only that, to protect your

data, but also to protect your hardware where your data resides, the software that controls that data

and any of the services that runs on top of those software.

All right.

It security prevents malicious threats and potential security breaches that can have a huge impact on

your organization when you enter your internal company network.

I.T. security helps ensure only authorized users can access and make changes to sensitive information

that resides there.

I.T. security works to ensure the confidentiality of your organization's data.

So security can be applied at the following levels.

It can be applied at the hardware operating system, application network, storage, data base and virtualization

or cloud level.

You do need security on all of these components and security wraps around all these components in the

later lectures.

When we get to the broader topics on the security, I will cover what are the security threats, how

the security can be breached, what kind of security breach there are, and how are different ways to

protect our computers.

So stay tuned.

I'll see you in the next lecture.
