Hello and welcome back.

In this video, we are going to talk about the application right from the image you will see that's

a third layer of the image where the application runs on top of the operating system.

And users like us access those applications.

So application is also one of the major components of computers.

Application is a program or a combination of programs designed for users to perform certain or desired

tasks.

Let's take a look at the certain examples of applications so we'll have a better understanding.

For example, Microsoft Word or Excel or PowerPoint or any of those Microsoft related applications are

of huge examples of what applications are Internet browser.

If you're using Firefox, Google Chrome or Microsoft Internet Explorer, those are all examples of application.

If you're talking about the corporate world, in the corporate world, there are many bigger applications

that manages your accounting or finances, and some of them like our ERP or SAP applications for mobile

users.

Like if you have a cell phone, you probably notice that there are millions of applications that you

could download from the Apple Store or Samsung store.

Those those are those tiny ones that actually gets downloaded on your phone.

It gets downloaded or your operating system.

And those are called apps short for applications.

To further clarify the difference between the software and application, A software is anything that

runs inside of a computer.

So a software can be in an operating system because it is something that you cannot touch and it goes

inside of your computer.

A software can be an application that you create and with a combination of a program or multiple program.

So anything that is inside of your computer is a software, and a software is very generic term that

is used for all those coding programs that you create to run your computer.
